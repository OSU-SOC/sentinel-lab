Sentinel Lab is a fork of Azure Sentinel2Go, an open source project developed to expedite the deployment of an Azure Sentinel lab along with other Azure resources and a data ingestion pipeline to consume pre-recorded datasets for research purposes. It also comes with the option to ingest pre-recorded datasets from the [Mordor project](https://mordordatasets.com/) right at deployment time.
